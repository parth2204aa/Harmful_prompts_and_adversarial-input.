# Harmful_prompts_and_adversarial-input.
This project builds a test suite to evaluate how an AI model responds to harmful or adversarial prompts. It sends unsafe inputs (e.g., violent, toxic, or prompt injection attacks) to the model, analyzes the response using a toxicity detector (Detoxify), and flags failures when the model outputs harmful content.

# 🛡️ Harmful_prompts_and_adversarial-input

A robust framework for evaluating how large language models (LLMs) respond to harmful prompts and adversarial inputs. This toolkit is designed to simulate attacks, detect vulnerabilities, and improve the ethical and safe behavior of AI systems.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on generating and testing harmful, toxic, biased, or adversarial prompts to evaluate LLM responses. It provides tools to simulate red teaming, test safety filters, and analyze model robustness against manipulative or unethical inputs.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Curated prompt sets across multiple harm categories
- 🧠 Prompt injection and jailbreak simulation
- 🔍 Toxicity and bias detection modules
- 📊 Safety scoring and behavior evaluation
- 🔌 Pluggable LLM backends (OpenAI, Local APIs, etc.)
